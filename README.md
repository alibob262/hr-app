## For Mr. Marwan

This application was built using angular version 17 and it uses standalone components.

I have sent an invitation for you (received on your email )to check out the firebase database. Inside you will find authentication and  firestore database which contains my 4 tables created exactly like in the requirements document.

The app is role based, you can create as many users (employees) as you want however the only available admin is with the name "Marwan Helou". 
To login:   marwan@hr.com
            marwan123

You can create a new employee account or you can sign in in one of the employees that i created:
to login:   ali@ccc.com
            ali123

Throughout the app, you will see that only the admin can edit all employees. Only the admin can view the bar charts. Only admin can see the leaves and expenses submitted by ALL employees. Admin cannot submit expenses or leaves. The admin is also able to reject or accept the leaves of the employees by clicking on the tick or the cross. 

Employees will only be to view expenses/ leaves for their own, they cannot see the bar charts, and they can only edit their own information .

I have refrained from using material components/ component libraries as much as possible and only used it in places to make the app responsive, and have a better UI UX.
